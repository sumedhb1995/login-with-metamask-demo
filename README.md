# PostMint

## Getting Started

There are 2 packages in this repo: a [`backend`](./packages/backend) which is a REST API written in Express, and a [`frontend`](./packages/frontend) which is a React single-page application. It's really a demo, so I tried to use as few libraries as possible, and the most popular ones when possible.

The simplest way to get started is to launch the demo using Docker Compose. Alternatively you could launch docker the containers manually, or run the node services using yarn.

#### Start the demo using Yarn:

From the root folder of this repo, run

```bash
sh setup.sh
yarn start
```

The backend should be running on `localhost:8000`, and the frontend on `localhost:3000`.

Alternatively, you can start the frontend and the backend separately:

```bash
# Start the backend
cd packages/backend
yarn start

# Start the frontend
cd packages/frontend
yarn start
```
